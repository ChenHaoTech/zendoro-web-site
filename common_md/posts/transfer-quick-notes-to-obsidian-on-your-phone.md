Are you tired of waiting for Obsidian to load?

Well wait no longer! Because Fleeting Notes provides a quick and easy way to take quick notes and have them automatically synced to Obsidian. Combined with a multitude of features you know and love from Obsidian, Fleeting Notes will fit perfectly into your workflow. To list a few:

* Blazing-fast launch speeds to take note of your fleeting ideas
* Autocomplete wikilinks to help build your network of ideas
* A link-first UI to make link traversal silky smooth
* [End-to-end encryption](end-to-end-encryption-in-fleeting-notes.md) so you can be confident of the security of your notes
* To top it off, an Obsidian plugin to keep your [Fleeting Notes in sync with Obsidian](sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian.md).

Fleeting Notes came from a [personal pain point with taking quick notes in Obsidian](put-quick-notes-into-obsidian-from-anywhere.md) and has evolved to the app you see now. I hope this app can also help you as well.
