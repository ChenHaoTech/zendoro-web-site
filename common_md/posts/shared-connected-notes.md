Connected notes are [powerful](../notes/connecting%20ideas%20is%20powerful.md). They allow you to expand upon different ideas within its own context and make it easy [reuse](../notes/reusing%20components%20is%20more%20efficient.md) notes.

There exists Obsidian publish but this service is gated by a paywall and is geared towards content creators. Sometimes [we want to share a note](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/vf8vx6/do_you_want_to_share_your_connected_notes/) (+ all the links within the note) without the hassle of setting up a website or paying a monthly fee. Some example use cases include:

* explaining a concept to a friend
* sharing notes for a particular class
* showcasing the coolness of your connected notes!

So in Fleeting Notes I added a sharing feature that makes it possible to share connected notes. The awesome part of this—and how it relates to Obsidian—is that Fleeting Notes can [sync with Obsidian](sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian.md) through a plugin. With this you can have shared notes (in Fleeting Notes) that are also synced with your Obsidian vault.
