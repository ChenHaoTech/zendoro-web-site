## Intro Blurb

I've talked a lot about how [Zettelkasten is complicated](zettelkasten-shouldnt-be-complicated-but-it-is.md) but I've never dove deeper into exactly how I use Zettelkasten to take notes. In order to [lead by example](../notes/lead%20by%20example.md), every week, I will read an article and [take connected notes](simplest-way-to-use-zettelkasten-for-note-management.md). Hopefully, this process can give you ideas about how to improve your Zettelkasten workflow. Also, feel free to suggest articles you want me to read next week.

## My Notes

**Article Link:** https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/

* I collect things mainly because of [loss aversion](../notes/loss%20aversion.md) I don't want to potentially lose some knowledge I find meaningful
* merging content, information, ideas, and thoughts and processing it is what integrates knowledge into our brain [connecting ideas is powerful](../notes/connecting%20ideas%20is%20powerful.md)
* bookmarking is great for navigation when you want to revisit something but is NOT good for learning [photocopying items doesn't help with learning](../notes/photocopying%20items%20doesnt%20help%20with%20learning.md)
* I don't really get the reward like these doves. For me it's just an unnecessary step.
* I don't think reading is pointless without note taking. It still helps us but the portion of information we absorb is a lot less.
* first step to conquering [collectors fallacy](../notes/collectors%20fallacy.md) is to realize that collecting notes does not increase knowledge
* [brain is better with small cycles of info](../notes/brain%20is%20better%20with%20small%20cycles%20of%20info.md)
