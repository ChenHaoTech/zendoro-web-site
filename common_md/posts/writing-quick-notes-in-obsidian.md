## Writing Quick Notes in Obsidian

When using Obsidian I know that [having more connections is better](../notes/having%20more%20connections%20is%20better.md). So I often take it upon myself to use Obsidian for everything. Thanks to the plugin system provided by Obsidian, it [personalizes](../notes/the%20future%20is%20personalization.md) the way I use Obsidian and allowed me to do many things that would otherwise be impractical (e.g. getting my TODOs from Todoist). But even with this customizability, sometimes Obsidian just isn't the [right tool for the job](../notes/use%20the%20right%20tool%20for%20the%20job.md). One example is writing quick notes into Obsidian. 

When writing quick notes, I'm often in midst of something and I want to jot down something in the most frictionless way possible. With Obsidian, there's a lot of friction.

Points of Friction in Obsidian (Desktop):

* Switching windows to Obsidian
* Opening a new or existing note
* Renaming the title from "Untitled"
* Clicking into the note
* Typing the "quick" note
* Switching back to the original window

## Fleeting Notes x Obsidian

Although these points seem trivial, I've noticed that they add up and have prevented me from writing more notes or even any notes at all. Oftentimes I find that [the best ideas come when I'm least prepared](../notes/opportunities%20are%20for%20the%20prepared.md) to write them down. Therefore I've decided to create an entire application called [Fleeting Notes](https://fleetingnotes.app/). As the name suggests, the app is solely dedicated to writing your fleeting thoughts. 

So how is "Fleeting Notes" better than Obsidian? It's not. 

[Fleeting Notes](https://fleetingnotes.app/) *enhances Obsidian.* It allows me to write quick notes (wth links + backlinks) within my browser and syncs seamlessly with Obsidian through a [plugin](sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian.md). Feel free to try it and if you're interested also join my [discord channel](https://discord.gg/xrj6yuGNmx).
