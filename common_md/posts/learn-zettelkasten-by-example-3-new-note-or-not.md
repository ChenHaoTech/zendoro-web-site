## Intro Blurb

In this post, I [write fleeting notes](simplest-way-to-use-zettelkasten-for-note-management.md) on an article titled "When Should You Start a New Note?". This article gives tips on when to create a note and when to use an existing note. Hopefully, this process can give you ideas about how to improve your Zettelkasten workflow

## My Notes

**Article Link:** https://zettelkasten.de/posts/when-start-new-note/

* sometimes it's difficult to know whether to create a new note or append an existing note. And that can stop note-taking entirely because [there is cost in starting an activity](../notes/there%20is%20cost%20in%20starting%20an%20activity.md). the most important thing is to just start writing and worry about organization second. [starting is always better than not doing anything](../notes/starting%20is%20always%20better%20than%20not%20doing%20anything.md)
* probably one of the most important things about Zettelkasten is that you're always in search for related or already existing notes. because [reusing components is more efficient](../notes/reusing%20components%20is%20more%20efficient.md)
* expanding a new note can be dangerous because it might take the atomicity out of the note making it harder to reuse the component. [reusing components is more efficient](../notes/reusing%20components%20is%20more%20efficient.md). So it's better to keep notes smaller and contained
* [notes are too big when info retrieval is slow](../notes/notes%20are%20too%20big%20when%20info%20retrieval%20is%20slow.md)
* the process of taking notes with Zettelkasten is organic. The types of connections you make change and adapt as you develop better systems of connecting things. Reminds me of the brain. [the brain has an organic structure](../notes/the%20brain%20has%20an%20organic%20structure.md)
* best not to overthink things or else you lose speed and productivity [starting is always better than not doing anything](../notes/starting%20is%20always%20better%20than%20not%20doing%20anything.md)
* [no universal guideline](../notes/no%20universal%20guideline.md)
