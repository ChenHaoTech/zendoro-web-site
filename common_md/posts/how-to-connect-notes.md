With apps like Obsidian and Logseq, building connections between notes has never been easier. Simply add double-square brackets and you’re good to go. But the thing is, it’s hard to know when to connect your notes. When notes are overly connected or sparsely connected the whole network of notes becomes less effective. In this post, I’ll walk you through my best method of connecting notes.

## Steps

1. Begin writing a note about anything
1. You come across a topic that *you think will probably come again in the future*
1. Search if the topic you want to expand upon already exists. Link it if it does.
1. If it doesn’t exist, create the link and expand upon the topic within the new note.
1. Go back to the previous note and continue writing what you were writing

## Example:

**1. I summarized an [article](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_atomic) into two bullet points and wrote them down:**

* **Atomic notes** make it easier to build connections across topics and contexts (because they are singular in idea)
* It's not effective to have too many connections OR too few connections. There needs to be a **middle ground**, and that is **dependent on the person**. 

**2. While writing I came across a few topics I wanted to expand upon. Topics are bolded above.**

**3. I searched my notes and found two notes that were relevant:  [atomic notes](../notes/atomic%20notes.md) and [the future is personalization](../notes/the%20future%20is%20personalization.md)**

**4. I created the third note: [the middle way](../notes/the%20middle%20way.md) and expanded upon it within the note**

**5. I added links to the note and finished what I was writing! Here's the final result:**

* [Atomic notes](../notes/atomic%20notes.md) make it easier to build connections across topics and contexts (because they are singular in idea)
* It's not effective to have too many connections OR too few connections. There needs to be a [middle ground](../notes/the%20middle%20way.md), and that is [dependent on the person](../notes/the%20future%20is%20personalization.md). 

You'll notice over time as more connections are added, you'll be spending less time creating notes and more time connecting them. If you have any questions or comments don't hesitate to put them below!
