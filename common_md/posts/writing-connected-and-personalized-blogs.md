So originally my blog was hosted on [https://thinkwong.com](https://thinkwong.com). It used WordPress which was good for typical blogging, but I wanted more than that. I wanted to demonstrate the effectiveness of connected notes and the best way to do that was to [lead by example](../notes/lead%20by%20example.md). Hence, I created a website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using a [digital garden template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template). And because [interoperable components are efficient](../notes/interoperable%20components%20are%20efficient.md) I write less while providing more value.

Since content is condensed into atomic bits, I can create highly personalized blog posts that allow the reader to dive deeper into whichever idea they find interesting. Knowing that [time is the most valuable resource](../notes/time%20is%20the%20most%20valuable%20resource.md), I can save both your time and mine! I believe [the future is personalization](../notes/the%20future%20is%20personalization.md) and creating an interconnected system through Fleeting Notes is a way to achieve this.
