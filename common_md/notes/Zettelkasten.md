This is a [unique note organization method](https://zettelkasten.de/) that functions in a similar vein to a brain—through the [connection of ideas](connecting%20ideas%20is%20powerful.md). It is [proven to promote learning](connecting%20ideas%20improves%20learning.md) and isn’t restricted by any hierarchical structure. As a result, note discovery is as simple as “[following a train of thought](following%20a%20train%20of%20thought.md)”.
