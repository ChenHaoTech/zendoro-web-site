title: To create useful links, we need to connect, not group

The focus for creating useful links is on making connections between notes and NOT making groups. Ideas need to be [atomic](atomic%20things%20are%20self-contained.md) and grouping things doesn't create atomic ideas.

When we don't create links atomic links (e.g. `[[school]]`), there will be many connections with very little meaning, adding [clutter](clutter%20slows%20us%20down.md).
