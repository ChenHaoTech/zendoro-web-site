Fleeting Notes is a scratchpad for taking quick short-form notes on your phone or while [browsing the web](../posts/best-browser-extension-for-obsidian.md). In the context of Obsidian, it solves the problem of taking [quick notes within Obsidian](../posts/put-quick-notes-into-obsidian-from-anywhere.md). What makes Fleeting Notes different from other short-form note-taking apps is its ability to build connections between notes and [sync with Obsidian](../posts/sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian.md) through an Obsidian plugin.
